[SpreeDeliverySlots](https://github.com/vinsol-spree-contrib/spree-delivery-slots)
==================

[SpreeDeliverySlots](https://github.com/vinsol-spree-contrib/spree-delivery-slots) allows customer to select preferred delivery time for his order. Admin can add a number of time slots(ex: 11:00 AM - 3 PM and 4 PM - 9PM) when he can deliver from shipping method edit/new page. Customer will be able to select only from these pre-created time slots.

Features
--------

* While placing the order customer will be able to select the delivery time while selecting the shipping method.

* Once a order has been placed admin will be able to see the preffered delivery time in order's shipment page and can deliver accordingly.

* Delivery slot info will also be present in shipped email.

Installation
------------

Add spree_delivery_slots to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_delivery_slots', git: 'https://github.com/vinsol-spree-contrib/spree-delivery-slots'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_delivery_slots:install
```

Testing
